These are the implementations of various fast algorithms.  The implementations are automatically generated by the gen.py file in the codegen directory.

The naming convention for the algorithms that we have found is

	fast{m}{k}{n}_{rank}_{nnz}.hpp

m, k, and n refer to the dimensions of matrices in the base case (m x k multiplied by k x n), rank is the number of multiplications used, 
and nnz is the number of nonzeros coefficients.

We also include:

  The 3 x 3 x 3 and 3 x 3 x 6 algorithms from Smirnov's paper:
    Smirnov, A. V. "The bilinear complexity and practical algorithms for matrix multiplication." Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics 53.12 (2013): 1781-1795.

  The classical matrix multiplication algorithm from recursion (classical222.hpp and classical333.hpp).

  Strassen's algorithm (strassen222.hpp)

  Bini's approximation algorithm (TODO: citation).
